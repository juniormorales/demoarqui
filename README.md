       > git clone https://github.com/ritwickdey/Cake-Shop.git
       > cd Cake-Shop/
    ```
    - Now Open the `CakeShop.sln` through `VS2017`.
    - Open `appsettings.json` & change the connection string. (But wait! you may not need to change it as this the default connection string of `SQL Server Express` that comes with `Visual Studio`).
    - Hit `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build.
    - Open `Package Manager Console` from `Tools` and enter `update-database`.
    - Hit `Ctrl+F5` to run without debugging.

- **Using CLI**
    ```
        > git clone https://github.com/ritwickdey/Cake-Shop.git
        > cd Cake-Shop/Cake-Shop/
        > npm install
        > dotnet restore
        > set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
        > set ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection="<YOUR CONNECTION STRING>"
        > npm i webpack -g
        > webpack --config webpack.config.js
        > npm run build
        > dotnet build 
        > dotnet ef database update
